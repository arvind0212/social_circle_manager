## Design System Implementation

### Color Palette
We've implemented the project's color palette using static constants in the `ThemeProvider` class:
- Primary (Blue - #4A90E2): Core UI elements, navigation, primary actions
- Secondary (Purple - #7B1FA2): Reserved for AI/LLM-related elements
- Accent (Peach - #E07A5F): For positive call-to-action, highlights, subtle backgrounds/borders
- System colors (Success, Warning, Error, Info): Appropriately configured

### Component Library
We're using shadcn_ui (v0.25.0) configured in Material hybrid mode:
- The `ShadApp.material()` approach is used for better compatibility with Material components
- `ThemeProvider` manages theme mode (light/dark) and color constants
- Key `shadcn_ui` components used effectively in Onboarding, Login, and Circles screens:
  - `ShadButton` (standard, outline, ghost variants, with gradients)
  - `ShadInputFormField` with validation
  - `ShadForm` for structure
  - `ShadCard` (customized with background opacity, borders, shadows, padding)
  - `ShadDialog` for prompts
  - `ShadThemeData` for consistent theming
  - `ShadColorScheme` integration
  - `ShadAvatar` for member profile images

### Iconography
Using standard Material icons:
- Decision to revert to Material icons due to naming compatibility issues with hugeicons
- Standard Flutter `Icon` widget with appropriate color theming
- Contextual icons used in `CircleCard` (e.g., `Icons.movie_outlined`, `Icons.book_outlined`) and `EmptyCirclesState`.

### Animations
We're using two primary animation libraries:
- `flutter_animate`:
  - UI animations (fades, slides, scales) implemented across Onboarding, Login, and Circles screens.
  - Staggered list animations in `CirclesScreen`.
  - Pulsing/scaling effects in `EmptyCirclesState`.
  - FAB scale animation in `CirclesScreen`.
  - "Breathing" animation for logo in Login screen.
  - Step transitions in Circle Creation Dialog.
  - Staggered appearance of form elements.
- `pretty_animated_text`:
  - Used in Onboarding screens.
  - Potentially useful for specific highlights, but used sparingly.

#### Animation Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Login screen animations are still staggered despite attempts to synchronize them. Needs refactoring.

## Specific Screen Implementations

### Login Screen
- Implemented using shadcn_ui components.
- Responsive layout, animated background, loading states, password toggle.
- Animations attempt to match Onboarding but suffer from staggering issue.

### Circles Screen (Detailed Above)
- Represents the target design aesthetic for core feature screens.
- Focus on clarity, subtle details, gradients, and purposeful animations.

### Circle Detail Screen
- Comprehensive view of a circle's information and activities.
- Responsive design handling different screen sizes.
- Smooth animations for content transitions.
- Organized sections for overview, events, and members.

### Circle Creation Dialog (Detailed Above)
- Multi-step form with smooth transitions and comprehensive data collection.
- Focused on user experience with clear guidance and visual feedback.
- Integration with device contacts for member selection.

## Navigation and Routing
- ‚úÖ Fixed circular dependency issues between model files.
- ‚úÖ Implemented navigation from circle listing to circle detail screen.
- ‚úÖ Using `MaterialPageRoute` for stability.
- ‚úÖ Lazy initialization in `HomeScreen`.
- ‚úÖ Consistent navigation pattern implemented.

## Best Practices & Conventions

### File Naming & Organization
- Following standard Flutter/Dart conventions (snake_case, suffixes).
- Feature-first organization structure maintained.
- Resolved import organization to prevent circular dependencies.

### State Management
- Using Provider (`ThemeProvider` implemented).
- `CircleCreationProvider` for managing multi-step form state.
- Form validation logic encapsulated in providers.

### Platform Integration
- Implemented contacts integration using `permission_handler` and `flutter_contacts`.
- Proper permission handling with user-friendly prompts and fallbacks.
- Platform-specific configurations (AndroidManifest.xml, Info.plist) for permissions.

### Design Philosophy (Emerged from CirclesScreen)
- **Clean & Elegant:** Prioritize clarity, readability, and uncluttered interfaces.
- **Warm & Inviting:** Use subtle gradients, rounded corners, soft shadows, and potentially accent colors to create a welcoming feel.
- **Modern:** Leverage contemporary UI patterns, smooth animations, and components like `shadcn_ui`.
- **Detail-Oriented:** Focus on spacing, alignment, typography, iconography, and interaction feedback (haptics, hover/splash effects).
- **Consistent:** Apply this aesthetic across all feature screens (Events, Explore, Profile) using shared components and themes.

### Responsive Design
- Implemented screen size detection for small/medium/large screens.
- Added proportional sizing for UI elements.
- Created adaptive layouts for different device dimensions.
- Used flexible containers and text overflow handling.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Firebase integration needs configuration.
- Supabase integration needs URL and anon key.
- Font assets (Inter) need to be downloaded and configured.
- Full accessibility implementation pending.
- Web platform may need additional configuration.
- Login screen animation staggering issue persists.
- Circle Creation Dialog lacks backend integration for actual circle creation.
- Interest badges have inconsistent colors between related categories.
- Member avatars need to display initials when profile photos aren't available.
- Some event cards have overflow issues on smaller screens.
- Layout overflow issues in some views need fixing with proper constraints.
- Circle Detail Screen's activity card has subtle layout inconsistencies that need to be addressed in a future enhancement.

## Next Steps

1.  **Fix Login Screen Animations:** Refactor to ensure simultaneous element appearance.
2.  **Complete Authentication Flow:** Implement registration, password reset, email verification using Supabase.
3.  **Implement User Profile:** Build ProfileScreen UI and functionality.
4.  **Implement Events Screen:** Design and build UI consistent with CirclesScreen aesthetic, integrate `device_calendar` if needed.
5.  **Implement Explore Screen:** Design and build UI consistent with CirclesScreen aesthetic.
6.  **Refine BottomNavBar:** Add active states and notification indicators.
7.  **Data Integration:** Replace mock data in CirclesScreen with real data (likely Supabase).
8.  **Backend Integration for Circle Creation:** Connect the Circle Creation Dialog to the backend.
9.  **Improve UI Component Consistency:** Standardize UI components like ShadAvatar across the app.
10. **Fix Layout Overflow Issues:** Address overflow problems in card layouts and responsive views.
11. **Enhance Circle Detail Dashboard:** Resolve the layout inconsistencies in the activity card of the Circle Overview dashboard.

## Design Considerations For Further Development

1.  **Responsive Design**: Continue improving adaptability across different screen sizes.
2.  **Accessibility**: Implement semantic labels, ensure touch target sizes, support text scaling.
3.  **Dark Mode**: Thoroughly test and refine dark theme implementation.
4.  **Offline Support**: Plan for caching and synchronization.
5.  **Performance**: Optimize widget builds, use `const`.
6.  **Hot Reload Stability**: Continue best practices.
7.  **Consistent Color System**: Implement a categorized color system for interest tags and visual elements.

## Integration Points

1.  **Supabase**: Backend (Auth, Database, Realtime).
2.  **Firebase**: Analytics, Remote Config, Crashlytics.
3.  **Device Integration**: 
    - `device_calendar` for calendar integration.
    - `flutter_contacts` for contacts access (‚úÖ Implemented).
4.  **Permissions**: 
    - `permission_handler` for platform permissions (‚úÖ Implemented for contacts).
5.  **Secure Storage**: `flutter_secure_storage` for sensitive data.
6.  **Network State**: `connectivity_plus` for offline handling.
