## Design System Implementation

### Color Palette
We've implemented the project's color palette using static constants in the `ThemeProvider` class:
- Primary (Blue - #4A90E2): Core UI elements, navigation, primary actions
- Secondary (Purple - #7B1FA2): Reserved for AI/LLM-related elements
- Accent (Peach - #E07A5F): For positive call-to-action, highlights
- System colors (Success, Warning, Error, Info): Appropriately configured

### Component Library
We're using shadcn_ui (v0.25.0) configured in Material hybrid mode:
- The `ShadApp.material()` approach is used for better compatibility with Material components
- ThemeProvider manages theme mode (light/dark) and color constants
- Successfully integrated shadcn components including:
  - ShadButton (standard and ghost variants)
  - ShadInputFormField with validation for form inputs
  - ShadForm for form structure and validation
  - ShadCard for content containers
  - ShadCheckbox for toggle inputs
  - ShadThemeData for consistent theming
  - ShadColorScheme integration

### Iconography
Using standard Material icons instead of hugeicons:
- Decision to revert to Material icons due to naming compatibility issues with hugeicons
- Standard Flutter `Icon` widget with appropriate color theming
- Consistent icon usage throughout the onboarding screen

### Animations
We're using two animation libraries:
- flutter_animate: For UI animations like fades, slides, and scaling
  - Implemented in both onboarding and login screens
  - "Breathing" animation for logo in login screen matches onboarding style
- pretty_animated_text: For text animations with different styles
  - Successfully implemented in the onboarding screens

#### Animation Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Login screen animations are still staggered despite attempts to synchronize them
  - Form elements appear in sequence rather than simultaneously
  - Current implementation uses nested animations (AuthHeader, AuthFormContainer) which may be causing the staggered effect
  - Plan to refactor to use a single parent animation or coordinated animation group

## Login Screen Implementation
- Implemented using shadcn_ui components:
  - ShadForm with validation
  - ShadInputFormField with leading/trailing icons
  - ShadButton in various styles (primary, outline, ghost)
  - ShadCheckbox for "Remember me" option
- Responsive layout with proper scrolling behavior
- Animated background gradient matching onboarding screen style
- Loading state indication in login button
- Password visibility toggle
- Attempted to match onboarding screen animation style with:
  - Background gradient transitions
  - Logo "breathing" animation
  - Form elements fade-in
  
## Navigation and Routing
- ‚úÖ Fixed circular dependency issues in screen navigation
- ‚úÖ Improved navigation by replacing PageRouteBuilder with MaterialPageRoute:
  - More stable during hot reload
  - Prevents class initialization errors with circular dependencies
  - Consistent navigation experience across the app
- ‚úÖ Modified HomeScreen to initialize screens lazily in initState to avoid circular reference issues
- ‚úÖ Consistent navigation pattern implemented across all screens

## Best Practices & Conventions

### File Naming
- Following snake_case convention: `onboarding_screen.dart`, `login_screen.dart`
- Using appropriate suffixes: `_screen.dart`, `_widget.dart`, etc.

### Code Organization
- Feature-first organization:
  - Features: auth, circles, events, chat, billing, explore, profile
  - Core: app setup, theme, etc.
  - Shared components: reusable widgets

### State Management
- Using Provider for state management
- ThemeProvider implemented as a ChangeNotifier with theme mode toggle functionality

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Firebase integration needs configuration with actual Firebase project details
- Supabase integration needs URL and anon key
- Font assets (Inter) need to be downloaded and configured
- Full accessibility implementation pending
- Web platform has been added to the project but may need additional configuration
- Login screen animations appear staggered despite attempts to synchronize them

## Next Steps

1. Fix login screen animation issues:
   - Refactor to use a single parent animation or coordinated animation group
   - Ensure all elements appear simultaneously rather than sequentially

2. Complete authentication flow:
   - Complete login with Supabase integration
   - Registration screen
   - Password reset flow
   - Email verification

3. Implement user profile:
   - Profile screen
   - Profile editing
   - Preference settings

4. Begin implementing circles feature:
   - Circle creation
   - Circle management
   - Member invitation

5. Complete tab screens in HomeScreen:
   - Implement CirclesScreen with actual circle listings
   - Build EventsScreen with calendar and event management
   - Develop ExploreScreen for content discovery
   - Finish ProfileScreen with user information and settings

## Design Considerations For Future Development

1. **Responsive Design**: All screens should be created with responsiveness in mind
2. **Accessibility**: Maintain proper contrast ratios, semantic labels, and support for screen readers
3. **Dark Mode**: Dark theme is implemented but needs testing
4. **Offline Support**: Plan for offline capabilities in future data modules
5. **Performance**: Use const constructors where possible and monitor widget rebuilds
6. **Hot Reload Stability**: Continue to avoid circular dependencies and use lazy initialization where appropriate

## Integration Points

1. **Supabase**: Backend integration via supabase_flutter
2. **Firebase**: Analytics, remote config, and crashlytics integration
3. **Device Integration**: Calendar integration via device_calendar package
