- ‚úÖ Fixed app initialization and navigation issues that were causing crashes

### Phase 1: Authentication & User Profile (üîÑ In Progress)
- ‚úÖ Implemented login screen with shadcn_ui components
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Login screen animations need refinement to match onboarding experience
- üîÑ Next steps: Implement registration screen and authentication logic

### Phase 2: Core Features Implementation (üîÑ In Progress)
- ‚úÖ CirclesScreen: Implemented with enhanced design aesthetics.

## Implemented Screens

### Fully Implemented
- ‚úÖ OnboardingScreen: Complete with animations, page transitions, and navigation
- ‚úÖ LoginScreen: Complete with form validation, animations, and navigation

### Partially Implemented
- üîÑ HomeScreen: Basic structure with bottom navigation and screen switching implemented
  - Uses IndexedStack for maintaining screen state when switching tabs
  - Includes screen transitions and animations
  - Missing: Content for the main dashboard view

- ‚úÖ **CirclesScreen**: Significantly enhanced beyond skeleton.
  - **Features**:
    - Displays a list of circles using `CircleCard` widget (populated with mock data).
    - Shows an `EmptyCirclesState` widget when no circles are present.
    - Includes a `FloatingActionButton` for creating new circles (triggers a `ShadDialog`).
    - AppBar features title, logo, search, filter, and demo toggle actions with themed styling.
    - Implements subtle background gradients and decorative pattern elements.
    - Uses `flutter_animate` for staggered list item animations and FAB entrance animation.
    - Implements haptic feedback for interactions (`_handleCircleTap`, `_handleCreateCircle`).
  - **Design Aesthetics**:
    - Aimed for a clean, elegant, warm, and inviting feel, consistent with Onboarding.
    - Polished, modern interface with attention to detail.
  - **Key Widgets Developed**:
    - `CircleCard`: Displays individual circle information with refined styling (avatar with border/shadow, name, member count badge, last activity with contextual icon, chevron). Card styling uses subtle transparency, borders, and shadows.
    - `EmptyCirclesState`: Visually rich empty state with:
      - Animated decorative background circles (pulsing effect).
      - Gradient text title ('No Circles Yet').
      - Engaging description text.
      - Benefits list using themed icons and containers.
      - Prominent 'Create Your First Circle' button with gradient background and icon.

  - Missing: Real data integration, circle detail screen navigation, search/filter implementation.

- üîÑ EventsScreen: Skeleton implementation only
  - Basic screen structure defined
  - Missing: Event listing, creation functionality, and detail views. Needs styling consistent with CirclesScreen.

  - Basic screen structure defined
  - Missing: Content discovery and search functionality. Needs styling consistent with CirclesScreen.

- üîÑ ProfileScreen: Skeleton implementation only
  - Basic screen structure defined
  - Missing: User profile information, settings, and edit functionality. Needs styling consistent with CirclesScreen.

- üîÑ BottomNavBar: Functional component
  - Navigation between screens works properly
  - Uses standard Material icons.
  - Missing: Notification indicators and active states refinement.

## Design System Implementation

### Color Palette
We've implemented the project's color palette using static constants in the `ThemeProvider` class:
- Primary (Blue - #4A90E2): Core UI elements, navigation, primary actions
- Secondary (Purple - #7B1FA2): Reserved for AI/LLM-related elements
- Accent (Peach - #E07A5F): For positive call-to-action, highlights, subtle backgrounds/borders
- System colors (Success, Warning, Error, Info): Appropriately configured

### Component Library
We're using shadcn_ui (v0.25.0) configured in Material hybrid mode:
- The `ShadApp.material()` approach is used for better compatibility with Material components
- `ThemeProvider` manages theme mode (light/dark) and color constants
- Key `shadcn_ui` components used effectively in Onboarding, Login, and Circles screens:
  - `ShadButton` (standard, outline, ghost variants, with gradients)
  - `ShadInputFormField` with validation
  - `ShadForm` for structure
  - `ShadCard` (customized with background opacity, borders, shadows, padding)
  - `ShadDialog` for prompts
  - `ShadThemeData` for consistent theming
  - `ShadColorScheme` integration

### Iconography
Using standard Material icons:
- Decision to revert to Material icons due to naming compatibility issues with hugeicons
- Standard Flutter `Icon` widget with appropriate color theming
- Contextual icons used in `CircleCard` (e.g., `Icons.movie_outlined`, `Icons.book_outlined`) and `EmptyCirclesState`.

### Animations
We're using two primary animation libraries:
- `flutter_animate`:
  - UI animations (fades, slides, scales) implemented across Onboarding, Login, and Circles screens.
  - Staggered list animations in `CirclesScreen`.
  - Pulsing/scaling effects in `EmptyCirclesState`.
  - FAB scale animation in `CirclesScreen`.
  - "Breathing" animation for logo in Login screen.
- `pretty_animated_text`:
  - Used in Onboarding screens.
  - Potentially useful for specific highlights, but used sparingly.

#### Animation Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Login screen animations are still staggered despite attempts to synchronize them. Needs refactoring.

## Specific Screen Implementations

### Login Screen
- Implemented using shadcn_ui components.
- Responsive layout, animated background, loading states, password toggle.
- Animations attempt to match Onboarding but suffer from staggering issue.

### Circles Screen (Detailed Above)
- Represents the target design aesthetic for core feature screens.
- Focus on clarity, subtle details, gradients, and purposeful animations.

## Navigation and Routing
- ‚úÖ Fixed circular dependency issues.
- ‚úÖ Using `MaterialPageRoute` for stability.
- ‚úÖ Lazy initialization in `HomeScreen`.
- ‚úÖ Consistent navigation pattern implemented.

## Best Practices & Conventions

### File Naming & Organization
- Following standard Flutter/Dart conventions (snake_case, suffixes).
- Feature-first organization structure maintained.

### State Management
- Using Provider (`ThemeProvider` implemented). Needs expansion for feature states.

### Design Philosophy (Emerged from CirclesScreen)
- **Clean & Elegant:** Prioritize clarity, readability, and uncluttered interfaces.
- **Warm & Inviting:** Use subtle gradients, rounded corners, soft shadows, and potentially accent colors to create a welcoming feel.
- **Modern:** Leverage contemporary UI patterns, smooth animations, and components like `shadcn_ui`.
- **Detail-Oriented:** Focus on spacing, alignment, typography, iconography, and interaction feedback (haptics, hover/splash effects).
- **Consistent:** Apply this aesthetic across all feature screens (Events, Explore, Profile) using shared components and themes.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Firebase integration needs configuration.
- Supabase integration needs URL and anon key.
- Font assets (Inter) need to be downloaded and configured.
- Full accessibility implementation pending.
- Web platform may need additional configuration.
- Login screen animation staggering issue persists.

## Next Steps

1.  **Fix Login Screen Animations:** Refactor to ensure simultaneous element appearance.
2.  **Complete Authentication Flow:** Implement registration, password reset, email verification using Supabase.
3.  **Implement User Profile:** Build ProfileScreen UI and functionality.
4.  **Implement Events Screen:** Design and build UI consistent with CirclesScreen aesthetic, integrate `device_calendar` if needed.
5.  **Implement Explore Screen:** Design and build UI consistent with CirclesScreen aesthetic.
6.  **Refine BottomNavBar:** Add active states and notification indicators.
7.  **Data Integration:** Replace mock data in CirclesScreen with real data (likely Supabase).
8.  **Circle Detail View:** Implement navigation and screen for viewing/managing a single circle.

## Design Considerations For Future Development

1.  **Responsive Design**: Ensure adaptability across different screen sizes.
2.  **Accessibility**: Implement semantic labels, ensure touch target sizes, support text scaling.
3.  **Dark Mode**: Thoroughly test and refine dark theme implementation.
4.  **Offline Support**: Plan for caching and synchronization.
5.  **Performance**: Optimize widget builds, use `const`.
6.  **Hot Reload Stability**: Continue best practices.

## Integration Points

1.  **Supabase**: Backend (Auth, Database, Realtime).
2.  **Firebase**: Analytics, Remote Config, Crashlytics.
3.  **Device Integration**: `device_calendar`.
4.  **Permissions**: `permission_handler` (likely needed for calendar).
5.  **Secure Storage**: `flutter_secure_storage` for sensitive data.
6.  **Network State**: `connectivity_plus` for offline handling.
